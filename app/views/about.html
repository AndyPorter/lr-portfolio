			<li>The Portfolio Team will help you define the problem you want to solve and consult over 30 colleagues across DWP for feedback.</li>
			<li>Following the consultation stage we will finalise an Discovery Approval Document.</li>
			<li>We will then present the problem to the BTG MTM who decide whether to approve discovery.</li>
			<li>If discovery is approved it's prioritised by the BTG management team and added to the portfolio backlog. Priorities are ratified by the Business Design Authority.</li>
			<li>The items in the backlog are mobilised in order of priority as soon as they have the right people for the task, as determined by the Challenge and Support Forum.</li>
